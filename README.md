# Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is used to organize a given array or list of elements that need to be ordered.

## Index

* Selection Sort
* Buble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort

## Selection Sort

The selection sort is the most simple sort algorithm. It consisted of two nested loops.

1) The first loop goes from the begin until the end, and call the second loop.
2) The second loop finds the next smaller value in the unsorted part of the array.

These steps are repeated until the end of the array to be achieved and all values are sorted.

## Bubble Sort

The buble sort algorithm works by repeateddly swapping the adjacents elements if they are in wrong order.

## Time Complexity
 
Algorithm | Best Case | Worst Case | Extra Space 
----------|-----------|------------|------------
Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1)
Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(1)
